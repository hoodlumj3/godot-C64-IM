# godot-C64-IM
A recreation of the Commodore 64 classic Impossible Mission in GODOT - as close as i can get it.

This is a learning project in GODOT for me
If I can successfully recreate Impossible Mission then I will have definitely learnt something.

All graphics have been ripped from the original game via screenshots and pasted into a paint.net document, cropped, organised and exported to png.
